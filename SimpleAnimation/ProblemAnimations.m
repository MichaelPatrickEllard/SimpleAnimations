// The following animation doesn't work.  The star doesn't fade out or even become hidden. 'hidden' is not an animatable property, so it's not unusual that it doesn't fade out, but it is surprising that it doesn't disappear at all.  It appears that UIView is overoptimizing this animation, and given that it is first becoming hidden and then becoming unhidden, the end state is the same as the beginning, and nothing happens.  This appears to be a bug in UIKit, which is present in the iOS Simulator and on device with iOS 5.1, but will hopefully be fixed in a future release.  

- (IBAction)doNotFadeTapped:(id)sender 
{   
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^
     {
         self.nonFadingStar.hidden = true;

          {
              self.nonFadingStar.hidden = false;
          }];
     }];
}

//It just blinks out.  The reason is that UIView's hidden property is not an animatable property, so setting hidden to true causes the view to simply vanish, not fade out in an animated way.  

//  The UIView documentation usually lists which properties are animatable and which are not.  

//  Note: this code a little more complicated than one might expect it to be, since if you set hidden to true in an animation block and then set it to false in a completion block or even an independent block that executes after a delay, UIView will detect that the end state is the same as the beginning state, and it won't bother to hide the star. 


- (IBAction)blinkTapped:(id)sender 
{
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^
    {
        self.blinkStar.hidden = true;
    }];
    
    double delayInSeconds = 2.0;

         {
             self.blinkStar.hidden = false;
         }];
    });
}

// This animation works.  The code is essentially the same as blinkTapped:, but in this case we're using the alpha property, so everything animates nicely.  Views with an alpha of 0 are just like views whose hidden value is true - they're not visible and they don't respond to touch events.  

- (IBAction)fadeTapped:(id)sender 
{   
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^
     {
         self.fadeStar.alpha = 0;

// We have animation in this one, but way too much.  The problem is that the transition occurs in the context of the superview of the view being transitioned away from.  Since the superview of the view being transitioned away from is UIViewController's main view, the whole screen flips.  

- (IBAction)flipTooMuchPressed:(id)sender  
{
UIView *copiedView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.flipTooMuchView.frame];
copiedView.backgroundColor = self.flipTooMuchView.backgroundColor;

[UIView transitionFromView:self.flipTooMuchView

                completion:^(BOOL finished)
 {
     self.flipTooMuchView = copiedView;
 }];
}


// This method doesn't work.  Everything is correct, but there's one problem: there are a couple of Apple constants that have very similar names.  The correct option here is UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromLeft.  We've used UIViewAnimationTransitionFlipFromLeft - note the lack of 'Option' in the middle - and that makes the animation fail.  

- (IBAction)flipTooLittlePressed:(id)sender 
{
    UIView *copiedView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.flipTooLittleView.frame];
    copiedView.backgroundColor = self.flipTooLittleView.backgroundColor;

         self.flipTooLittleView = copiedView;

// This method works correctly.  We create a new view, and flip to it!  Woo hoo, it works!

- (IBAction)flipCorrectlyPressed:(id)sender

// This animation doesn't work.  The problem is that UIView tries to optimize the animation as much as possible, so it compares the end state with the beginning state.  A full rotation will mean that the end state and beginning state are the same, so UIView optimizes this animation by simply not moving the star at all.  

- (IBAction)doNotRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                     animations:^
     {
         [self spinStar:immobileStar noOfRotations:1];
     }];
}

// This animation kind of works, but not the way we might want.  In this case, we're doing series of rations that take the star exactly 180Â° - 1/2 way around the circle.  UIView looks at the beginning state and end state, and optimizes how to get from the beginning state to the end state.  Oddly enough, in doing the initial rotate, it goes counter-clockwise.  However, if you rotate it again, it will go clockwise the next time.   

- (IBAction)wrongWayRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                     animations:^
     {
         [self spinStar:wrongWayStar noOfRotations:0.5];
     }];
}

// In this method, we're doing a series of 1/4 rotations.  This works, but the animation is jerky.  The reason that it's jerky is that the default for animations is "ease in / ease out", meaning that the animations will go slowly at the beginning and end of the animation, then more quickly in the middle.  In an animation that is really a series of animations chained together, this causes jerky updating.  

- (IBAction)jerkyRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    static int animationCounter = 0;

    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                     animations:^

     {
         animationCounter ++;
         
         animationCounter == 8 ? animationCounter = 0 : [self jerkyRotatePressed:nil];
     }];
}

//Finally, a working rotate!

- (IBAction)correctRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    static int animationCounter = 0;
    
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                          delay:0
                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveLinear
                     animations:^
     {
         [self spinStar:correctStar noOfRotations:.25];
     }
                     completion:^(BOOL finished)
     {
         animationCounter ++;
