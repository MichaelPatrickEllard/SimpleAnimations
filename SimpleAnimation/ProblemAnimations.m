#pragma mark - Initializers

// There's not much going on here in initWithNibName.  We do set the title and tab bar image so that this view controller's name and image will be shown in the tab bar.

#pragma mark - Star Fade examples

//  The following animation doesn't work.  The star doesn't fade out or even become hidden.  It just kind of flickers for a second. 

//  It appears that what's happening here is this:  'hidden' is not an animatable property, so shere is nothing animatable in this code.  Thus,  UIView applies the hidden property immediately.  UIView doesn't take a full second to do the initial animation, since there's nothing to animate for the requested duration.  Thus, it goes directly to the completion block, where there's also nothing to animate.  The result is that the star flickers out (i.e. is hidden) for a fraction of a second, and then is unhidden again.  

//  The lesson to take away here is that not every UIView or CALayer property is animatable.  The documentation is usually pretty clear about which properties are animatable and which aren't - if you're not sure, check the documentation or do a quick using some test code.   


- (IBAction)doNotFadeTapped:(id)sender 
{   
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^
     {
         self.nonFadingStar.hidden = true;
     }
                     completion:^(BOOL finished)
     {
         [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^
          {
              self.nonFadingStar.hidden = false;
          }];
     }];
}

//  In this example, the star doesn't fade.  It just blinks out.  This is better, but still not what we want.  

//  Our code here is essentially the same as the code above, but I've added a change to an animatable property along with my request to set the star's property to hidden.  The change is a barely noticable color change to a tiny helper view, but this is enough so that the initial animation block and the completion block will take the full duration that I've requested to complete.  

//  While the animated parts take a second to complete, hidden is not animatable and takes effect immediately.  


- (IBAction)blinkTapped:(id)sender 
{
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^
    {
        self.blinkStar.hidden = true;
        self.blinkHelperView.backgroundColor = [UIColor darkGrayColor];
        
    }
     completion:^(BOOL finished)

              self.blinkStar.hidden = false;
              self.blinkHelperView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
          }];

     }];
}

// This animation works.  The code is essentially the same as doNotFadeTapped:, but in this case we're using the alpha property, so everything animates nicely.  Views with an alpha of 0 are just like views whose hidden value is true - they're not visible and they don't respond to touch events.  

- (IBAction)fadeTapped:(id)sender 
{   
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0 animations:^
     {
         self.fadeStar.alpha = 0;

#pragma mark - Color Rotation

// The following animation won't work.  UIView only animates one change to a particular property at a time - a new animation request for a property that is already being animated will cancel the existing animation and replace it with the new animation request.  Since the same animatable property is being changed multiple times in the code below, all of the changes except the last change are ignored.  

- (IBAction)dontRotateColors:(id)sender 
{
    [UIView animateWithDuration:3.0 animations:^
     {
         self.rotateColorProblemView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
         self.rotateColorProblemView.backgroundColor = [UIColor redColor];
         self.rotateColorProblemView.backgroundColor = [UIColor orangeColor];

         self.rotateColorProblemView.backgroundColor = [UIColor purpleColor];
         self.rotateColorProblemView.backgroundColor = [UIColor blackColor];
     }];
}

//  The following routine illustrates a better way to rotate colors: Go through the desired colors one by one in separate animation blocks.   


- (IBAction)rotateColors:(id)sender 
{
    static NSMutableArray *colorArray = nil;
    
    // If no array of colors exists, create one.  
    
    if (!colorArray)
    {   colorArray = [NSMutableArray arrayWithObjects:[UIColor blackColor], [UIColor redColor], [UIColor orangeColor], [UIColor yellowColor], [UIColor greenColor], [UIColor blueColor], [UIColor purpleColor], [UIColor blackColor], nil];

     }
     completion:^(BOOL finished)
     {
         //  Remove the color that we just showed from the color array.
         
         [colorArray removeObjectAtIndex:0];
         
         //  This is a recursive method.  It will keep calling itself until all of the colors have been shown and the colorArray is empty.
         
         if ([colorArray count])
         {
             [self rotateColors:nil];
         }
         else 
         {
             //  Once all of the colors have been shown, set the colorArray to nil so that the next time the method is called it will start fresh and create a new color array with all of the colors to be shown.

         }
    }];

#pragma mark - Flip Animations

// We have animation in this one, but way too much.  The problem is that the transition occurs in the context of the superview of the view being transitioned away from.  Since the superview of the view being transitioned away from is UIViewController's main view, the whole screen flips.  

- (IBAction)flipTooMuchPressed:(id)sender  
{
UIView *copiedView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.flipTooMuchView.frame];
copiedView.backgroundColor = self.flipTooMuchView.backgroundColor;

[UIView transitionFromView:self.flipTooMuchView
                    toView:copiedView
                  duration:1.0 
                   options:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromLeft 
                completion:^(BOOL finished)
 {
     self.flipTooMuchView = copiedView;
 }];
}


// This method works correctly.  We create a new view, and flip to it!

- (IBAction)flipCorrectlyPressed:(id)sender 
{
    UIView *copiedView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.flipCorrectlyView.frame];
    copiedView.backgroundColor = self.flipCorrectlyView.backgroundColor;

#pragma mark - Spinning Animations

-(void)spinStar:(UIImageView *)whichStar
  noOfRotations:(float)noOfRotations
{
    whichStar.transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(whichStar.transform, noOfRotations * 2 * M_PI);
}


// This animation doesn't work.  The problem is that UIView tries to optimize the animation as much as possible, so it compares the end state with the beginning state.  A full rotation will mean that the end state and beginning state are the same, so UIView optimizes this animation by simply not moving the star at all.  

- (IBAction)doNotRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                     animations:^
     {
         [self spinStar:self.immobileStar noOfRotations:1];
     }];
}

// This animation kind of works, but not the way we might want.  In this case, we're doing series of rations that take the star exactly 180Â° - 1/2 way around the circle.  UIView looks at the beginning state and end state, and optimizes how to get from the beginning state to the end state.  Oddly enough, in doing the initial rotate, it goes counter-clockwise.  However, if you rotate it again, it will go clockwise the next time.

//  Hypothesis: the "wrong way" rotation is caused by the fact that the math for one rotation ends up with a positive rotation, while the math for the other ends up with a negative rotation.  You're encouraged to play with this, investigate the math, and see if you can find a way to make the 1/2 rotations spins work correctly.  

- (IBAction)wrongWayRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                    animations:^
    {
         [self spinStar:self.wrongWayStar noOfRotations:0.5];
    }];
}

// In this method, we're doing a series of 1/4 rotations.  This works, but the animation is jerky.  The reason that it's jerky is that the default for animations is "ease in / ease out", meaning that the animations will go slowly at the beginning and end of the animation, then more quickly in the middle.  In an animation that is really a series of animations chained together, this causes jerky updating.  

- (IBAction)jerkyRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    static int animationCounter = 0;

    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                     animations:^
     {

     }
                     completion:^(BOOL finished)
     {
         animationCounter ++;
         
         animationCounter == 8 ? animationCounter = 0 : [self jerkyRotatePressed:nil];
     }];
}

//Finally, a working rotate!

- (IBAction)correctRotatePressed:(id)sender 
{
    static int animationCounter = 0;
    
    [UIView animateWithDuration:1.0
                          delay:0
                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveLinear
                     animations:^
     {
         [self spinStar:self.correctStar noOfRotations:.25];
     }
                     completion:^(BOOL finished)
